title: I'm a finalist!
---

I entered my science-fantasy novel, **The Machinist**, into the PNWA unpublished writing contest earlier this year, and I was recently notified 
that it is a [finalist](https://www.pnwa.org/page/Finalists2023)!

The conference is in two weeks, and then I'll find out if it placed in the top three. Crossing my fingers!
