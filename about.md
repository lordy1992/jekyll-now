### About me

I am Jeremy Lord, a professional software developer. I live in Seattle now, but I'm originally from Vancouver, BC.

I set up this site as a repository for my scattered thoughts on software development, math fiction, and any other topic 
I find interesting. I am also an aspiring fiction writer, so I might post snippets of my work here if the spirit moves me.

### What, exactly, is Bogosort?
[Bogosort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort) is a stupendously inefficient sorting algorithm. The randomized version
randomly permutes its input until it happens to wind up sorted (so the worst-case performance is unbounded!).

Why did I name this blog Bogosort? If I were to be fully transparent - because it's a catchy sounding word, and it relates to computer science.
Now, here's my post hoc rationale: Given my family situation (as of writing this, my daughter is just about to enter her "terrible twos"), 
I may not have as much time to post as I would like, so my posts may come in slowly, and they may consist of a random sequence of topics that interest me,
much like randomized bogosort.
