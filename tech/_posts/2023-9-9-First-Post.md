title: Finally!
---

After years of consideration, and then weeks of procrastination (what tools should I use? Wordpress? Hugo? What should I write about? And so it goes...), I finally did it!
I set up a personal website. It didn't take much, but it sure took me a while to *just do it*.

And, in the end, that was the way to beat the procrastination. Just get something out there. Didn't have to be fancy.

Now that [bogosort](/about/) is up and running, I suppose I'll need to get writing! I don't expect to post
often (hence the name bogosort, that notoriously inefficient sorting algorithm), but now I have somewhere to jot down my thoughts when the mood strikes.
I plan on using this website as a repository for learnings in my personal endeavors, both in tech and (fiction) writing, and for updates on personal projects.

Maybe it will be of interest to others out there, but even if it isn't, at least it's a good excuse to document my work!
